## Key Questions Addressed
1. What factors most strongly influence booking cancellations?
2. How do seasonal trends affect reservation patterns?
3. Can we identify and characterize different customer segments?
4. What is the impact of pricing strategies on booking behavior?
5. How does lead time correlate with booking status and customer type?
6. Which room types and meal plans are most popular, and how does this vary by season or customer segment?

## Dataset Description
Our comprehensive dataset includes:
- Booking details: Check-in/out dates, length of stay, room type
- Guest information: Number of adults/children, repeat guest status
- Pricing data: Average daily rate, deposit type
- Market segment and distribution channel
- Special requests and booking modifications
- Cancellation status and lead time

## Key Features and Methodologies
- Advanced Time Series Analysis: Uncovering cyclical patterns in booking trends
- Customer Segmentation: Utilizing K-means clustering to identify distinct guest profiles
- Predictive Modeling: Developing a cancellation prediction model using Random Forest
- Interactive Visualizations: Creating dynamic Plotly dashboards for intuitive data exploration
- Statistical Hypothesis Testing: Rigorously validating findings and assumptions

## Technologies Showcased
- Python ecosystem: Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn for static plots; Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for predictive modeling and clustering
- Statistical Analysis: SciPy for hypothesis testing
- Jupyter Notebooks: For reproducible research and clear code documentation

## Key Findings and Business Impact
1. Cancellation Factors: Identified that lead time and pricing are the strongest predictors of cancellations, enabling targeted retention strategies.
2. Seasonal Trends: Discovered distinct booking patterns for business vs. leisure travelers, allowing for optimized pricing and inventory management.
3. Customer Segmentation: Identified 4 key guest segments with unique preferences, facilitating personalized marketing approaches.
4. Pricing Elasticity: Quantified the impact of price changes on booking probability, informing dynamic pricing strategies.
5. Lead Time Insights: Found that bookings with longer lead times have higher cancellation rates, suggesting opportunities for early engagement.
6. Room and Meal Preferences: Uncovered clear preferences in room types and meal plans across different customer segments, guiding inventory and service offerings.

## Visualizations and Insights
- Interactive Time Series: Demonstrating booking trends with the ability to zoom into specific date ranges
- Heatmaps: Visualizing correlations between variables like price, lead time, and cancellation probability
- Geospatial Analysis: Mapping guest origins to identify key markets and potential expansion opportunities
- Customer Journey Flowcharts: Illustrating the booking process and identifying drop-off points

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook hotel-reservation-data-eda.ipynb`
4. Explore the interactive visualizations and in-depth analysis

## Future Directions and Business Applications
- Implement a real-time cancellation risk scoring system
- Develop a recommendation engine for personalized upselling
- Create a predictive model for optimal room pricing
- Design a customer loyalty program based on segmentation insights
- Build an early warning system for overbooking risks

## Why This Project Stands Out
- Demonstrates strong data analysis skills applicable to various industries
- Showcases ability to translate complex data into actionable business insights
- Highlights proficiency in popular data science tools and methodologies
- Exhibits clear communication of technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders
- Provides a foundation for advanced machine learning and AI applications in the hospitality sector
